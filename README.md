## Project Description
I analyse the coffee ratings from 32 countries based on certain coffee metrics used for professional evaluation. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
I have formulate two hypotheses:
- Is the coffee from Ethiopia the best rated?
- Does altitude has an impact in the coffee quality?

## Dataset
I gathered data from the Coffee Quality Institute.

## Workflow
I first categorize the coffee by species and varieties and analyse the ratings. We end up evaluating the coffee based of its country of origen.

## Organization
I used trello for organizing my project.
